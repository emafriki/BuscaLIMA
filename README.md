In this repository we will recreate the minesweeper game using the Python programming language. 

To develop this game, we have used different Python packages.Here are the most important ones: 

|Package |Description            |Usage                  |

|tkinter |Tkinter is the package that is considered a standard for the graphical user interface for Python     |In this project, Tkinter fulfills the task of creating and managing the user interface|      

# Functioning
The player will have three options for the level they choose( easy, intermediate and difficult). Once the difficulty has been chosen, the interface will generate a grid where they can play.
